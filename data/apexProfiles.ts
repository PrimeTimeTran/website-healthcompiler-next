    intro:
      'In the dynamic world of healthcare, emerging models are reshaping traditional practices to tackle inefficiencies and enhance patient care. Direct Primary Care (DPC) is a groundbreaking approach that prioritizes patient-centered care, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. Under the Direct Primary Care (DPC) model, patients pay a regular monthly or annual fee directly to their primary care physician, bypassing conventional insurance methods for primary care services. This fee generally encompasses a wide range of services, including clinical visits, laboratory tests, consultations, and care coordination, fostering a more streamlined and personalized healthcare experience. To delve deeper into this revolutionary approach, we had the pleasure of speaking with Dr. William Burkhart, a third-generation primary care physician and founder of Burkhart Direct Family Care, and Mehul Agarwal from HealthCompiler, a data analytics platform and marketing solutions company dedicated to maximizing the value and driving the growth of direct care and self-funded plans.',

    intro:
      'In the heart of Tennessee, a quiet revolution in healthcare is taking place. At its center stands Dakota, a passionate physician assistant (PA) who has transformed her frustration with the traditional healthcare system into a thriving direct primary care (DPC) practice. Her story is not just one of personal triumph, but a beacon of hope for both healthcare providers and patients alike, showcasing a model that prioritizes quality care over quantity of patients seen.',

She enrolled in a health science bachelor's program with a concentration in radiology, but during her clinical rotations, she discovered her true calling.

    title: "Direct, Transparent, and Personal: Inside Dr. Raymond Kordonowy's Approach to Care",
    intro:
      'From his early training to a pioneering practice in Florida, Dr. Raymond Kordonowy has built a career around challenging the status quo. Among the first physicians to experience hospital employment during the HMO boom, he saw firsthand how bureaucracy and third-party payers compromised patient care. Rather than accepting the system, he created his own path, developing a membership-based model that blends Direct Primary Care with inpatient advocacy, technology, and radical transparency.',

          "Dr. Raymond Kordonowy's story begins in Kansas, where he studied liberal arts with a chemistry emphasis at the University of Kansas. He stayed at the same institution for medical school in Kansas City. During rotations, he realized internal medicine was where he belonged: 'I liked the differential diagnosis. I always wanted to be kind of a patient's main doctor.'",
          "He married between his first and second year of medical school, started a family during residency, and eventually relocated to Florida, where his wife's family had moved. After residency and a chief residency in Atlanta, he joined two private practices in Fort Myers. These practices eventually merged and sold to Columbia Health Care in the mid-90s, making him one of the first primary care physicians to experience hospital system employment.",

          "Frustration with third-party medicine grew as he saw bureaucracy take over patient care. Medicare's RVU payment system drove reimbursements down. Prior authorizations, administrative burden, and insurer control only worsened.",
          "'I realized that the third-party system was destructive to my ethics and something I just couldn't function well in,' he explains. He left his old group when they decided to stay in Medicare. For him, the path was clear: find a way to practice medicine on his own terms.",
          'A certified clinical lipidologist, Dr. Kordonowy wanted to spend time with patients teaching lifestyle changes and managing complex conditions like diabetes and cholesterol disorders. But under Medicare, a half-hour counseling visit could bankrupt a practice.',

          'His solution was bold: bundle his services into a membership model, with direct contracts between doctor and patient. This approach would eliminate billing codes, prior authorizations, and dependence on insurers.',
          "He structured pricing based on real operating costs, including diagnostic tools, staff, and technology. 'I didn't want to sit and submit codes for payment. It's a huge drag on the cost of a practice to have to get your money from third parties.'",
          'This model gave him freedom to innovate. Instead of waiting for a new billing code to try an idea, he could introduce services immediately. He also leveraged bulk lab pricing to offer patients transparent, affordable options.',

          "One of Dr. Kordonowy's most unique innovations was the Inpatient Advocate Service. When hospitalist medicine displaced primary care doctors from inpatient care, patients lost continuity. He stepped in to restore it.",
          "'I created what's called the Inpatient Advocate Service,' he says. 'It allows me to maintain my relationship and care with my patients, influencing and informing the hospitalist team with all the things I knew before the patient came to them.'",
          "He would visit patients in the hospital at the end of his workday, help them navigate conflicting consultant opinions, clarify medications, and bring social context that hospitalists often missed. The service became a cornerstone of his 'Premier Program,' bundled into membership for patients.",

Over time, he embraced both the concierge and Direct Primary Care (DPC) labels, recognizing his hybrid model offered something unique—outpatient DPC with inpatient continuity.",
          "The membership model also unlocked a new kind of patient relationship. Every new patient visit includes a broad health and wellness assessment, complete with antioxidant testing and lab panels. 'Metrics is the new medicine,' he says. 'When patients can see visually what's happening, they're motivated to change their behavior.'",

          "'I envision direct primary care physicians becoming the virtual hospital,' he explains. 'We can do telemetry, vital signs, medications, even coordinate with home health or infusion companies. A lot of problems can be managed at home if you've got the right support system.'",

          "Dr. Kordonowy believes more private physicians will 'leave the system' to reclaim their profession through Direct Primary Care. He sees doctors evolving beyond diagnosticians to serve as coaches, advocates, and even brokers for their patients. His Fort Myers practice, now home to three physicians, embodies this vision. Dr. Kordonowy's work reflects a simple but powerful truth: when physicians reclaim autonomy, patients regain real care.",
