                  Welcome to Health Compiler! These Terms of Service ("Terms")
                  govern your use of Health Compiler Inc.'s ("Health Compiler",
                  "we", or "us") offerings for direct care providers, including
                  any related software or services (the "Service"), which are
                  made available through our website,
                  https://www.healthcompiler.com/, and any associated sites or
                  mobile applications (collectively, the "Platform"). Your
                  access and use of the Service are subject to these Terms. By
                  accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have
                  read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
                  do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the
                  Service.

                <p className='text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed'>
                  By accepting these Terms through an online order document or
                  executing an order form referencing these Terms (each an
                  "Order Form"), you affirm that you have read, understood, and
                  agree to be bound by these Terms. You also confirm that you
                  are of legal age to enter into a binding contract with Health
                  Compiler and have the authority to do so on behalf of any

                  may not access or use the Service.

                <p className='text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed'>
                  For certain customers, these Terms may be part of another
                  agreement, such as an enterprise master services agreement
                  ("MSA"). In case of any conflict between these Terms and the
                  MSA, the MSA will prevail.

                  The Service is provided as software-as-a-service ("SaaS"),
                  meaning it is accessed through the Platform and not installed
                  locally on your devices. This ensures efficient delivery but
                  requires uniform application of these Terms. For inquiries,
                  please contact us at support@compile.health.

                <p className='text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed'>
                  Please review these Terms carefully, as they may be updated
                  periodically. We reserve the right to revise and update these
                  Terms at our discretion. Material changes will be notified to
                  you through the Platform or via the contact information you
                  provided. Revised Terms will be effective thirty (30) days
                  after such notice, unless a longer notice period is required
                  by Applicable Law. Your continued use of the Service after the
                  effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If
                  you reject the updated Terms within the notice period, the
                  previous terms will remain in effect unless terminated
                  according to their terms.
