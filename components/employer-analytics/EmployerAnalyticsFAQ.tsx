    question: 'What is employer healthcare analytics?',
    answer:
      'Employer healthcare analytics is the practice of unifying claims, benefits, clinical, and workforce data to help self-funded employers understand how their healthcare dollars are being spent, identify cost-saving opportunities, and make evidence-based benefits decisions. Unlike traditional reporting — which tends to be backward-looking and fragmented — modern employer analytics platforms like HealthCompiler provide real-time intelligence that connects financial performance, clinical outcomes, and workforce health.',
  },
  {
    question: "How is HealthCompiler different from my TPA's reporting?",
    answer:
      "TPA reports are limited to claims data — and typically arrive weeks or months after the fact. HealthCompiler ingests claims alongside pharmacy, clinical, benefits, HRIS, and wearable data, normalizes everything into a single member record, and gives you a live view of your plan's performance. It's the difference between a rearview mirror and a windshield.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to replace my current vendors to use HealthCompiler?',
    answer:
      "No. HealthCompiler is designed to sit on top of your existing ecosystem. We integrate with your TPA, PBM, stop-loss carrier, HRIS, DPC provider, and other data sources through standard file feeds and API connections. You keep your vendors — you just finally get to see whether they're working.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does implementation take?',
    answer:
      "Most employers are fully onboarded and seeing live data within two weeks. We handle the data integration, normalization, and validation. Your team doesn't need to build anything.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is HealthCompiler HIPAA compliant?',
    answer:
      "Yes. HealthCompiler is fully HIPAA compliant and uses enterprise-grade encryption, access controls, and audit logging. We're built for organizations that handle sensitive health information and take data security seriously.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can my broker or consultant access the platform?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. HealthCompiler supports role-based access, so your broker, consultant, and internal leadership team can all view the same data — with appropriate permissions. This creates a shared language for benefits strategy conversations.',
