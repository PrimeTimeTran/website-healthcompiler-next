            Most Employers Are Flying Blind on Healthcare Spend
          </h2>

          <div className="space-y-6 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg">
            <p>
              Here's the reality for most self-funded employers: you're spending 20–40% of your
              total compensation budget on healthcare, and you don't really know what you're getting
              for it. Your TPA sends one report. Your PBM sends another. Your stop-loss carrier has
              their own version of the truth. And by the time anyone stitches it together, open
              enrollment is already over.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's not just inconvenient — it's a fiduciary risk. When you can't see where the
              money goes, you can't defend how it's spent. And when you can't connect health
              outcomes to plan design choices, you're guessing at the single biggest line item on
              your P&L after payroll.
